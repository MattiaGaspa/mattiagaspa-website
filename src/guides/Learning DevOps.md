# The DevOps Culture and Infrastructure as Code practices

DevOps stands for _Development_ and _Operations_. It's a term often associated with the practices of **Continuous Integration** (CI) and **Continuous Development** (CD) and with **Infrastructure as a Code** (IaaC).

## Getting started with DevOps

The term was introduced in 2007-2009, and the term is used to refer to the practices that aim to reduce the barrier between _developers_, who innovate and deliver, and _operations_, who want to guarantee stability.

DevOps is an extension of agile processes. The collaboration between Dev and Ops is achieved by:

- More frequent application development with CI and CD.
- The implementation and automation of unit and integration tests, which can be **behavior-driven design** (BDD) or **test-driven design** (TDD).
- Collecting feedback from users.
- Monitoring applications and infrastructure.
- Collaboration.
- Processes: The DevOps process is divided into several phases that are repeated cyclically:
  - Planning and prioritizing functionalities.
  - Development.
  - Continuous integration and delivery.
  - Continuous deployment.
  - Continuous monitoring.
- Tools: Choosing the right tools for the job can close the communication gaps.
  Developers need to use the Ops tools to detect performance problems as soon as possible, and Operations must automate the process of creating and updating the infrastructure. Furthermore, the DevOps culture can be divided into three axes: the collaboration, the process, and the tools.

Donovan Brown's definition of DevOps is:

> "DevOps is the union of people, processes, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users."

The benefits, within an enterprise, of a DevOps culture are:

- Better collaboration and communication in teams.
- Shorter production times, and thus better performance and end user satisfaction.
- Reduced infrastructure costs, thanks to IaC.
- Less time wasted, thanks to iterative cycles, which reduce application errors, and automation tools, which reduce manual tasks.

## Implementing CI/CD and continuous deployment

### Continuous Integration

The definition of CI, by Martin Fowler, is:

> "Continuous integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently... Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible."

So CI is and automatic process that check that the application's code is complete and correct every time a member makes a change.

#### Implementing CI

To set up CI, it is necessary to have a **Source Code Manager** (SCM) that will centralize the code of all members, this manager can be of any types (e.g., git, SVN, etc.). It's also important to have an automatic _build manager_ that supports continuous integration (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.).

Each team member will work on the application code daily. Then, several times a day, each team member will archive or commit their code, preferably in small commits to easily fix errors. The commits will be integrated into the rest of the code, along with other members' commits, thanks to the CI process.

The CI server, which will execute the CI process, needs to be automated and triggered by each commit. After retrieving the code, the server will:

1. Build the application package.
2. Perform unit tests, and calculate code coverage.
   Code that is archived will not be processed by the CI process. Deactivating a test execution must be done if and only if it is necessary to deliver quickly or if the code added in the commit is not essential to the application.
   CI, however, cannot catch all errors, especially those that happens in production. Therefore, the time needed to fix production errors is taken from the time saved by the CI process.

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery comes after the CI process is passed, and its process is to deploy the application automatically in non-production environments (_staging_).

The process starts from the application package, built by CI, which will be installed through automated tasks. During this phase, it is also possible to execute functional and acceptance tests.

Unlike CI, in CD the application is tested with all of its dependencies. If the application in question is a microservice application, then:

- CI will test the single microservice in development.
- CD will test and validate the entire application, as well as the APIs.

In practice, CI and CD are linked in an _integrated_ environment, so that the developer can execute unit tests and test the whole application. It's important that the package generated by CI and the package installed in all the environments must be the same; however, configuration files can differ depending on the environment.

The tools necessary for CI/CD are:

- A package manager.
- A configuration manager: To manage configuration changes in CD.
  The deployment of the application in each staging environment can be triggered:
- Automatically: After the successful execution in the previous stage.
- Manually: In case of a sensitive environment, such as the production one, that may require manual approval from a person responsible for validating the application.

### Continuous deployment

It's an extension of CD, it consists of a process that starts with the developer's commit and ends with the deployment in production of the change.

This practice is rarely implemented because it requires a variety of tests to guarantee that the application works. In addition, the continuous deployment process must take into account all the steps to restore the application in the event of a production problem.

It is used for:

- Toggling features: It permits toggling application's functionalities without the need to redeploy the application.
- Blue-green production infrastructure: This infrastructure ensures no downtime during deployment. There are 2 environments, one green and one blue; first you deploy to the blue and then to the green.

The diagram is the same as CD, but with the difference that it has an automated end-to-end deployment.

### Understanding IaC practices

It's a practice that consists of writing the code for the resources that make up an infrastructure.

This practice is widely used since:

- Deploying infrastructures manually takes a lot of time and there can many manual errors.
- Scalability is important in cloud computing.

#### Benefits of IaC

- Having a standard infrastructure reduces errors.
- The code that generates the infrastructure can be versioned.
- The deployment of the infrastructure is faster, thanks to the integration into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Reduced costs, management, and control.

#### IaC languages and tools

The languages and tools can be:

- Scripting: This category includes tools such as Bash, PowerShell and clients provided by the cloud provider. The problem with these types of tools is that they require a lot of lines of code.
- Declarative: These tools allow to define an infrastructure by writing its configuration and properties in a file. Examples are Terraform, Vagrant and Ansible.
- Programmatic: The infrastructure is programmed with a declarative language, similar to the one used by developers. Examples are Pulumi and Terraform CDK.

#### The IaC topology

There are various IaC typologies:

- Deploying and provisioning the infrastructure: Where you instantiate the resources that make up the infrastructure. They can be of the **Platform-as-a-Service** (PaaS) and the serverless resource types but also the entire network.
- Server configuration and templating: Where you configure the virtual machines. To optimize the process, it is possible to use server models, called _images_.
- Containerization: An alternative to deploying applications on VMs. The most used technology is Docker and the containers are configured with a Dockerfile.
- Configuration and deployment in Kubernetes: Kubernetes is a container orchestrator that deploys containers, manages the network architecture, and handles volume management. It is configured with YAML files.

# Provisioning Cloud Infrastructure with Terraform

Terraform is one of the most popular tools for IaC. In this chapter we will be using Terraform with Azure.

An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and a [code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is needed for this chapter.

## Installing Terraform

### Manual installation

- Reach the [download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) page.
- Unzip and copy the binary into an execution directory.
- Add that directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

### Installation by script on Linux

The installation on Linux can be done via script or via the `apt` package manager:

- Script installation:
  ```bash
  TERRAFORM_VERSION="1.0.0" #Update with your desired version
  curl -Os https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/${TERRAFORM_VERSION}/terraform_${TERRAFORM_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip \
  && curl -Os https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/${TERRAFORM_VERSION}/terraform_${TERRAFORM_VERSION}_SHA256SUMS \
  && curl https://keybase.io/hashicorp/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import \
  && curl -Os https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/${TERRAFORM_VERSION}/terraform_${TERRAFORM_VERSION}_SHA256SUMS.sig \
  && gpg --verify terraform_${TERRAFORM_VERSION}_SHA256SUMS.sig terraform_${TERRAFORM_VERSION}_SHA256SUMS \
  && shasum -a 256 -c terraform_${TERRAFORM_VERSION}_SHA256SUMS 2>&1 | grep "${TERRAFORM_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip:\sOK" \
  && unzip -o terraform_${TERRAFORM_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip -d /usr/local/bin
  ```
- With the `apt` package manager:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl \
  && curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add - \
  && sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" \
  && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform
  ```

### Integrating Terraform with Azure Cloud Shell

Terraform is integrated into the Azure Cloud Shell. The steps to enter the shells are:

- Log in into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
- Open the `Cloud Shell` and choose it's mode: It's either Bash or PowerShell.
- Run `terraform` from the command shell.

## Configuring Terraform for Azure

To provision in a cloud infrastructure like Azure, we must first configure Terraform to allow the manipulation of resources in an Azure subscription.

To do this, we will create a new Azure **Service Principal** (SP) in Azure **Active Directory** (AD), an _application user_ who has permission to manage Azure resources.

### Creating the Azure SP

This step can be done from the portal or via script with the `az cli` command:

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name="<ServicePrincipal name>" --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>"
```

This command will return three things:

1. The application ID.
2. The client secret.
3. The tenant ID.

The SP is created in Azure AD:

### Configuring the Terraform provider

Now, we will configure our Terraform configuration to connect to Azure using this SP:

- In a directory of your choice, create the file `provider.tf` (`.tf` is the extension for Terraform files) and paste the code:
  ```terraform
  provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
    subscription_id = "<subscription ID>"
    client_id = "<Client ID>"
    client_secret = "<Client Secret>"
    tenant_id = "<Tenant Id>"
  }
  ```
- Since it is not advisable to put identification information in plain text, we will improve the preceding code with:
  ```terraform
  provider "azurerm" {
    features {}
  }
  ```
  And we will pass the identification information through environment variables:
  - `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.
  - `ARM_CLIENT_ID`.
  - `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`.
  - `ARM_TENANT_ID`.

### The Terraform configuration for local development and testing

To test the Terraform code quickly, it is possible to use your own Azure account. To do this, type `az login` before executing the code.

If there are several subscription you can use the command: `az account set --subscription="<Subscription ID>"`

## Writing a Terraform script to deploy an Azure infrastructure

We will provide a simple Azure architecture with Terraform that is composed of the components:

- Azure resource group.
- Network configuration: Composed of virtual network and subnet.
- In this subnet, we will create a VM with a public IP address.
  This code will be placed in `main.tf`, in the same directory as `provider.tf`.

For the `resource` group:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
	name = "bookRg"
	location = "West Europe"
	tags {
		environment = "Terraform Azure"
	}
}
```

Any piece of Terraform code is composed of:

- A type of `resource` or `data` block.
- A name of the resource to be managed (in this case `azurerm_resource_group`).
- An internal Terraform ID (in this case `rg`).
- A list of properties of the resource.

For the network interface part:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
	name = "book-vnet"
	location = "West Europe"
	address_space = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
	resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
}
resource "azurerm_subnet" "subnet" {
	name = "book-subnet"
	virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.name
	resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
	address_prefix = "10.0.10.0/24"
}
```

In this code we will create a VNet, `book-vnet`, and a subnet, `book-subnet`. We can also see that for the IDs we use pointers on the Terraform resources.

For provisioning the virtual machine we will need:

- A network interface:
  ```terraform
  resource "azurerm_network_interface" "nic" {
  name = "book-nic"
  location = "West Europe"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  ip_configuration {
  	name = "bookipconfig"
  	subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.subnet.id
  	private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
  	public_ip_address_id = "azurerm_public_ip.pip.id"
  }
  }
  ```
- A public IP address:
  ```terraform
  resource "azurerm_public_ip" "pip" {
    name = "book-ip"
    location = "West Europe"
    resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.rg.name}"
    public_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
    domain_name_label = "bookdevops"
  }
  ```
- An Azure Storage object for the diagnostics:
  ```terraform
  resource "azurerm_storage_account" "stor" {
    name = "bookstor"
    location = "West Europe"
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
    account_tier = "Standard"
    account_replicant_type = "LRS"
  }
  ```
  The type of storage, in our case, is Standard LRS.
- A virtual machine: We will be using an Ubuntu virtual machine:
  ```terraform
  resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "vm" {
    name = "bookvm"
    location = "West Europe"
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
    vm_size = "Standard_DS1_v2"
    network_interface_ids = ["${azurerm_network_interface.nic.id}"]
    storage_image_reference {
  	  publisher = "Canonical"
  	  offer = "UbuntuServer"
  	  sku = "16.04-LTS"
  	  version = "latest"
    }
    ...
  }
  ```

The complete source code is available [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-DevOps-Second-Edition/tree/main/CHAP02/terraform_simple_script).

### Following some Terraform good practices

Some good practices for writing good Terraform code are:

- Separate files: Since every file with the `.tf` extension in the `execution` directory will be automatically executed, it is good to separate the code into several files to improve readability:
  - `Rg.tf`: For the resource group.
  - `Network.tf`: For the VNet and subnet.
  - `Compute.tf`: For the network interface, public IP, storage, and VM.
- Protection of sensitive data: To store sensitive data, such as passwords, it is possible to use Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault. You can then retrieve them via Terraform.
- Configuration with variables and interpolation functions: Often the infrastructure that will host the application will be the same for all stages. However, some configuration may change from one stage to another. To make the code more flexible we can add variables with the following step:
  1. Declare the variables by adding the following code in the global Terraform code, or in a separate file `variables.tf`:
  ```terraform
  variable "resource_group_name" {
    description = "Name of the resource group"
  }
  variable "location" {
    description = "Location of the resource"
    default = "West Europe"
  }
  variable "application_name" {
    description = "Name of the application"
  }
  ```

  2. Initiate the values in a `.tfvars` file named `terraform.tfvars`, with the format `variable_name = value`.
  3. Use the variables in the code with the format `var.<name of the variables>`. For example:
  ```terraform
  resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  	name = var.resource_group_name
  	location = var.location
  	tags {
  		environment = "Terraform Azure"
  	}
  }
  ```
  In addition it is possible to use built-in [functitons](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions.html) that can be used to manipulate data or variables.
