# About Me

## Hi, I'm Mattia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of the University of Padua. I love learning about and using new tools and technologies that can help me in creating more efficient and effective programs. Currently, my main goal is to become a data server technician, network engineer, or DevOps engineer, but I'm open to exploring other areas in the tech field.

## My Story

My passion for technology started when I was young, by watching my father work with electronics. Later, in high school, I studied electronics, focused on automation (e.g. PLCs, sensors, and actuators), while self-studying computer science.

After high school, I started studying [Computer Engineering](https://www.unipd.it/offerta-didattica/corsi-di-laurea-triennale/ingegneria?tipo=L&scuola=IN&ordinamento=2020&key=IN0508) at the University of Padua.

## Technical Skills

Currently, for my personal projects, I'm using, and learning, various languages, frameworks and tools, including:

- **Rust**: for backend development, with the **[Actix](https://actix.rs/)** framework;
- **Golang**: for network programming and DevOps tasks;
- **Java**: for university;
- **Svelte**: for frontend development, with the **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)** framework;
- **Bun**: for JavaScript/TypeScript development, with the **[Bun.js](https://bun.sh/)** runtime;

## Beyond Studying

When I'm not using a computer, I'm passionate about playing the trumpet. I currently own two trumpets:

- _Yamaha YTR-3335_: bought in 2013 and it's my first trumpet;
- _Getzen 490-LV_: bought on February 25th, 2023 and it's my current trumpet.
