# University of Padua (UniPD) Notes

I started my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Padua in 2023. My notes are compiled from:
- Professors' lecture slides
- In-class explanations
- Recommended textbooks

You can find the complete list of course professors [here](https://didattica.unipd.it/off/2023/LT/IN/IN0508).

My Drive folder with all my notes is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_uVeRsQVpTflb2XQNf5NtEqwHd84CQtU?usp=sharing).
